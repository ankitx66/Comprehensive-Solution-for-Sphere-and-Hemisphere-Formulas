1. Imports: The math module is imported to use mathematical constants and functions like pi and exponentiation.

2. Functions:
sphere_formulas(radius): Computes surface area, volume, total surface area, and diameter of a sphere.
hemisphere_formulas(radius): Computes surface area, volume, base area, and total surface area of a hemisphere.

3. Main Function:
Prompts the user to enter the radius of the sphere or hemisphere.
Calculates the properties using the above functions.
Prints the results for both sphere and hemisphere properties.

4. Execution:
The main() function is called when the script is run directly (if __name__ == "__main__":).
